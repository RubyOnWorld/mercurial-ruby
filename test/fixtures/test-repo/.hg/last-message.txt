check-code: disallow use of hasattr()

The hasattr() builtin from Python < 3.2 [1] has slightly surprising
behavior: it catches all exceptions, even KeyboardInterrupt. This
causes it to have several surprising side effects, such as hiding
warnings that occur during attribute load and causing mysterious
failure modes when ^Cing an application. In later versions of Python
2.x [0], exception classes which do not inherit from Exception (such
as SystemExit and KeyboardInterrupt) are not caught, but other types
of exceptions may still silently cause returning False instead of
getting a reasonable exception.
